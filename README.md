# Python-GUI-Parser-Visualizer

This repository hosts "Final CompletePythonGUILexer.py," a Python script that combines lexical analysis and parsing functionalities within an interactive graphical user interface (GUI). Developed using the Tkinter library, this application is designed to analyze and process programming constructs, offering real-time visualization and feedback.

# Key Features and Functionalities:

1. Lexer Implementation:
- The script includes a lexer, specifically in methods like CutOneLineTokens, which tokenize input lines. It identifies various token types including literals, keywords, operators, separators, and identifiers, essential for parsing programming languages.

2. Interactive GUI:
- The Tkinter-based GUI offers interactive elements such as text input areas for source code, tokenized output displays, parse trees, and current processing line indicators. User interaction is facilitated through control buttons for stepping through the code or exiting the application.

3. Parsing Operations:
- Functions like exp, if_exp, print_exp, and math handle the parsing of expressions, print statements, and if-else conditions. These methods demonstrate the script's capability in decomposing and understanding complex syntax.

4. Syntax Tree Visualization:
- A dynamic tree view component visualizes the syntactic structure of parsed expressions, enhancing the application's utility in understanding and debugging code.

5. Error Handling:
- The application robustly manages errors in the parsing logic, providing essential feedback on syntactic inconsistencies or issues in the input code.

6. Utility Functions:
- Methods such as clear_treeview are included for maintaining the operational state of the GUI, allowing for continuous and efficient parsing operations.

7. Executable Script:
- The script is structured to run as a standalone application, initializing the GUI and entering the main event loop, as indicated by the if __name__ == '__main__' block.

# Application Overview:
This Python GUI lexer and parser application stands as a sophisticated tool for programming language analysis. It offers a robust platform for developers and programmers to visualize and understand the tokenization and parsing of code, aiding in the debugging process and improving code comprehension.

# Overall Assessment:
The script represents a significant contribution to the realm of programming tools, showcasing advanced capabilities in GUI development, lexical analysis, and parsing in Python. Its emphasis on real-time feedback and visualization positions it as a valuable resource for code analysis and development.
